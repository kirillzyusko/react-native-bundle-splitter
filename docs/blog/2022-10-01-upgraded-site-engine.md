I'm happy to announce that I finally migrated website to the second version of Docusaurus. I hope you enjoyed new design, support for dark theme and many other UI perks.

Alongside with it I started to use GitHub actions for managing documentation and releases for this library. I think it can simplify the process and the interaction with potential contributors.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ˜Ž
