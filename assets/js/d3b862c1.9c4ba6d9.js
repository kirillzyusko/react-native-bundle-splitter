If earlier it was difficult to find a library that would support two platforms (iOS and Android) at the same time, now it is the de facto standard.\\n\\nAnd the boundaries of influence of the react-native framework are expanding. The development team plans to add support for windows, macOS as the default platform.\\n\\nTherefore, the new release adds support for the **web** platform (using `react-native-web`), **macOS** and **windows**.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Breaking changes\\n\\nFortunately, this release has fully backward compatibility with `1.x.x` release. But I\'d like to highlight some important changes:\\n\\n- `require` property in `register` function now marked as deprecated;\\n- `investigate` returns only initially loaded modules;\\n- screen gets mounted in `async` way.\\n\\nYou can read more about changes and migration in [upgrading from 1.x guide](../docs/guides/upgrading-from-1.x)\\n\\n## Improvements and future plans\\n\\nApart of that, documentation for 2.0.0 was updated. Now it includes updated code examples, more developer tips and so on.\\n\\nI\'m going to keep updating the documentation. I want to add snacks so that you can experiment with the code right in the browser and see how real applications are built using this library."},{"id":"version-1.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/react-native-bundle-splitter/blog/version-1.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-bundle-splitter/tree/master/docs/blog/2019-08-13-new-version-1.0.0.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-08-13-new-version-1.0.0.md","title":"Version 1.0.0 is released","description":"Version 1.0.0 is released!
