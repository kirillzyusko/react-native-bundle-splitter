title: New version 2.0.0 with web support

Announcement of new version release with more platforms support!

The react-native framework is actively developing. If earlier it was difficult to find a library that would support two platforms (iOS and Android) at the same time, now it is the de facto standard.

And the boundaries of influence of the react-native framework are expanding. The development team plans to add support for windows, macOS as the default platform.

Therefore, the new release adds support for the **web** platform (using `react-native-web`), **macOS** and **windows**.

## Breaking changes

Fortunately, this release has fully backward compatibility with `1.x.x` release. But I'd like to highlight some important changes:

- `require` property in `register` function now marked as deprecated;
- `investigate` returns only initially loaded modules;
- screen gets mounted in `async` way.

You can read more about changes and migration in [upgrading from 1.x guide](./../../../../docs/upgrading-from-1.x)

## Improvements and future plans

Apart of that, documentation for 2.0.0 was updated. Now it includes updated code examples, more developer tips and so on.

I'm going to keep updating the documentation. I want to add snacks so that you can experiment with the code right in the browser and see how real applications are built using this library.
